PyLmod provides a Python library to access the MIT Learning Modules web
service. This service, maintained by MIT Information Systems and Technologies
(IS&T) exposes an API to MIT systems of record for classes, students, and
grades. PyLmod was created to support MIT's
use of OpenedX for residential courses, but the library is open source
to enable easier access for Python application developers at MIT.
